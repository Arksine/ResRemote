.idc installation instructions

1) Make sure your device has root and is connected to your PC with android debugging enabled

2) Put your idc file in the same directory as adb.exe (typically (ANDROID_SDK_DIR)\platform_tools\)

3) Open a terminal / command prompt, navigate to the directory containing adb.exe, and enter the following commands :

adb root
adb remount
adb push Vendor_XXXX_Product_YYYY.idc /system/usr/idc/.
adb reboot

If you are using a rooted stock rom, the above commands may not work.  You need an app like ES File Explorer that can change system permissions.  Copy the .idc files to your devices internal store, then use ES File explorer to move them to the /system/user/idc directory.  Finally, change permissions to rw-r-r, with the owner and group set as root.  When finished change the system permissions back to read only. More in depth instructions to follow.

4) After reboot connect your arduino running the HID Resistive Remote sketch.  It should load the corresponding idc.  This can be verified with the following adb command:

adb shell dumpsys input

That command generates a lot of output.  Navigate to the top and find the header labeled INPUT MANAGER.  Find your device (likely the  last one in this list) and make sure there something listed next to ConfigurationFile:

*Note: In the .idc file, XXXX denotes the Vendor Id, and YYYY denotes the product Id.  Those ids arae listed in the dumpsys output as well.  You can also get them with the lsusb command (adb shell lsusb).
